# Busy Files Indicator

The Busy Files Extension for Visual Studio Code allows you to mark files as "busy" to prevent accidental edits and deletions, reducing the risk of merge conflicts and ensuring smoother collaboration among team members.

## Features

- Mark files as "busy" to indicate that they are currently being worked on and should not be edited by others.
- Prevent editing of busy files to avoid conflicts and maintain code integrity.
- Protect busy files from deletion to ensure important work is not lost.
- Clear visual cues to easily identify busy files within the VS Code workspace.

## Usage

1. Install the Busy Files Extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
2. Open the file you want to mark as busy.
3. Use the extension command to mark the file as busy.
4. The file will be visually marked as busy, and editing and deletion will be restricted.
5. To remove the busy status from a file, use the extension command again.

## Commands
